Thoughts on three main objects
* Habit
  * cyclical objectives, to be done multiple times
* Todos
  * one time small objectives
* Goals
  * large amorphous objectives
  * involves createing a "program" of Todos and Habits with parameters to meet to complete over months or years
    * examples
    * work out 3 times a week for a year
    * Do laundry all at once every time for a year
